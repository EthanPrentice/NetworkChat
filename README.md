# NetworkChat

Runs off a lot of the same architecture as Shaka2.
Before I integrated Shaka2's core architecture with Spotify I wanted to have something to show and work with so I built a UI with some simple messages to enable a network groupchat app.

Pretty much instead of users sharing a Spotify queue like they would in the Shaka app, they send basic chat messages back and forth to show how the core architecture works before I integrate with Spotify which will require a lot more work for UI / API integration than this simple chat app.  Programming this first at least gives me an idea for where my architecture was lacking and gives me something to show in my portfolio before I integrate.
